If Emily has 4 cucumber plants, how many vegetable plants does she have in total?', 'rationale': \"1. Let's start by figuring out how many tomato plants Emily has. Since she has twice as many tomato plants as cucumber plants, and there are 4 cucumber plants, she must have 4 * 2 = 8 tomato plants.\\n\\n\\n2. Next, we need to find out how many carrot plants Emily has. She has 5 fewer carrot plants than tomato plants, so she must have 8 - 5 = 3 carrot plants.\\n\\n\\n3. Now, we can add up the number of tomato, carrot, and cucumber plants to find the total number of vegetable plants Emily has: 8 tomato plants + 3 carrot plants + 4 cucumber plants = 15 vegetable plants.\\n\\n\\nSo, Emily has a total of 15 vegetable plants in her garden.\", 'answer': '15'}\n",
